# Translate REDCap Metadata
Here is the code that I used to translate REDCap metadata using DeepL's API (Deutsch -> English)

Completed: 22.04.24, Uploaded: 15.05.25, Last Tested: 22.04.24

translate_fields.R  - Translates form names and field labels

translate_choices.R - Translates Choices and Calculations

This was a one-and-done so there are several project-specific adhoc lines
